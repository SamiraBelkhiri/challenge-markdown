 #### You can always count on me

 when you need help or advice of some sort,
  you can always confide in me.
  I might not always have an answer but I will do my
  best to search for a solution or just be there for you.


  #### A funny story

  I went to a party with some friends, 2 cars and a total of 8 people.
  They got in a fight and one car left so we had to come back with 7 people in one car.
  lets just say i ended up in the trunk with my friend ...

  #### tldr
  Always depend on yourself
